## First VBA project


### Description

This script loops through all the stocks of multiple year and outputs the following information:

*    The ticker symbol for each stock every year

*   Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a year to the closing price at the end of that year,  for multiple years.

*   The percent change from opening price at the beginning a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, for multiple years.

*   The total stock volume of the stock for multiple years

In addition, the script highlights all the positive yearly changes in green, and the negative yearly changes in red to give a general idea at first glance.

Finally, it provides a quick summary of the greatest percentage increase as well as the greatest percentage decrease.
